# Repository for the COLING2020 Paper: "Multi-label classification with pre-trained language models"

This is the repository complementing our Paper submitted to the COLING2020 conference. 

We provide our used data in the folders "clean_data/" and " traintest_data/". The first contains the cleaned
and matched verbatim-codes data for all of our 10 thematic data sets. The second contains
the actually used train/test splits which have been split using a method developed by [1]
and implemented by [2]. The original, raw data come from the "Open Ended Coding Project" 
which accompanied the 2008 ANES survey conducted by [3]. All credit for the initial 
collection of the open-ended data goes to ANES and the principal investigators: Jon Krosnick,
Matt Berent and Arthur Lupia.

The creation of the cleaned data sets is described in our Paper. For a quick overview
on the used method, consider the following:
