1388,the real reason why he lost is barack obama being black. the african americans all voted for him. He used his race as an advantage and I think that was wrong. John mcccain was a lot smarter than obama. Obama has no experience. He only had 500 days as a senator and that to me is scary. The US might become communist.

1472,I think he lost because the media gave him little coverage and when they didit was neg. and they gave obama all the coverage and it was all positive and they gave him a free pass on negative issues such as rev. wright and the bill ayres.ACORN was a factor also & the media never investigated the fact that he wasn't a natural born citizen as they would have anyone else.//no,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1
