And she would probably have inquired of him before she made a move in any direction and we'd have to go through his shenanigans again.  I'm afraid we're in for some bad bad times ahead.... since she's gotten that position... when Obama nominated her for Secretary of State.  things look mighty bad to me.  She was a thief you know?
