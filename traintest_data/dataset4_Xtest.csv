16,"I think he has a lot of new ideas, and even tho I don't think when you're president you can't always implement your ideas... but the fact that he has new ideas and can communicate them means that some of those things might actually happen.  We can always find new ways to do things.  I loved his selction for his running mate.  I watched the panels during the primaries and I think Joe Biden did the best of everyone.  He has many of the same strength as mcCain in terms of experience and working with all types of people.  I think he was a great choice.  i like the way he's energized the young voters... we need them.  He's a wonderful communicator and a wonderful role model for a lot of young black me... he is someone they can look at and say ""maybe I want to be like him."" He's been as positive as you can be - although some of his ads have been negative too.  I know he's amart enough to put together the right people to know what he needs to know if he's elected.... looks like he's going to be.  Between Barack Obama and Hillary clinton... I know all things she's done for children in the past... I would have voted  for her before Barack Obama.  Usually the Democrats 
are more willing to fund when it comes to health and human services."

He is charismatic, a good listener, willing to listen in all debates, has been fair.  he has the suit for candidate.  In the younger generation is not the same old, same old like bush and mccain.  He is also realistic.  Last debate take time to fix this economy, he was honest not lying, said it will take more than 4 years to fix.  Extremely intellectual and cerebral.

830,He's about a positive direction and both him and his white are more believable.
832,"Health care; money lobbiests are getting is too much and needs to come back to Main St America; spending money for community like for health care, job benefits, keeping jobs in America, rather than overseas; thinks we should give tax breaks to the people instead of to corporate America; giving breaks to lower income Americans will help the economy more; giving rich more money is just not right."

1022,I think he has good issues and I think he is for the working poeple.
1030,what I'm am thinking about is that he will bring some change that we need and what the late J F kennedy did.
1036,he is beleivable.something about him that he seems he is going to change the world. wanted him to pick hiary for vp or hilary would have won i wanted her to pick him. I wanted them to both be on the ticket. the war needs to stop send our troops home. innocent kids are dying.
1039,what he stands for and his opinion about abortion and gun control.
1055,"He was poor,and he's also had a diversed life style. He seems like he could do as good of a job as his white associates."
1066,It's about time for a black president.
1067,His platform seems alittle more in line with what I'm looking for like healthcare and other things that would savage the middle care.

I like his race -- half black and half white -- which is representative of our country.  I like his choice of Senator Biden.  He's a good extemporaneous speaker.  He knows how many houses he owns.  Good family values."

1502,that he's black
1531,"I think he's more ""down home"" For example, his mother passed early age and fought insurance companies till she died, and I don't think she should have to do that.  We pretty much didn't have a problem with insurance in the 60's and mid 90s, but today you to fight get anything out of them"
