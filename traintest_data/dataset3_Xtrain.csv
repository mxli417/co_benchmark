700,Their stands on abortion
704,"Don't agree with working class people paying for nonworking class people to have the same stardard of living, any social programs provided should come with some type to work requirement to receive the money. The US has created a system where people are dependent on them and we will not be able to sustain it...by the time I am 41 or 48, I can't afford another 15-20% to support other people.  Cannot keep supporting people without people earning it, this promotes at sometime a dictatorship.  People should be self supporting we are in danger of losing our democracy."

I am tired of the so called ""hidden agendas"" such as breaking down the religious and family values that have upheld our country for so many generations. The global warming issues are tiresome as well as environmental issues. Why do we as americans compromise our economy when all the other nations take a back seat. I am in favor of the environment being protected but not to the extent where it is all or nothing in reference to energy issues.  I feel the democratic party often creates emotional turmoil in our country. They do this by focusing on the emotions of minorities, and culturally diverse populations.  This does not solve problems or reach solutions.  The tax burdens placed on the american people is ridiculous.  Also the assumption that we - the american people are out of touch with big government - is underestimated."

810,"They seem to have lost their touch with the working people in terms of protecting jobs, etc. They seem to want to have more government interfering with your lives. Always looking for more taxes. I don't think (especially congress) is interested in doing what needs done to save this country. Bill Clinton pushed through NAFTA - I think that was the wrong thing to do.

875,THEY ARE MORE LIBERAL AND DO NOT HAVE THE GENERAL PUBLIC'S INTEREST AT HEART.
876,"THEY DON'T STAND UP FOR THEMSELVES ENOUGH.  THEY LET GEORGE W BUSH PUSH THEM AROUND.  HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN IMPEACHED. DURING THE LAST ELECTIONS, THE DEMOCRATS DID NOT STAND UP TO NEGATIVE CRITICISMS BY THE REPUBLICANS, JOHN KERRY IS AN EXAMPLE."

1104,the abortion factor
1106,I'm not so sure that the party has very strong convictions; the party has to water down its message in order to get elected in this political
1107,I think that both parties are set up ads theatre to distract the American public from the fact that they have no real power; that those who are elected rarely change anything; they are designed to fool people into thinking that they can make a difference
1109,their views on the so-called pro-choice which is anti-choice for the baby (murder); I can't get past this one issue to even consider voting for a Democrat on any level even if they're not part of the process that affects the issue; when you say Democrat I think extremely ignorant
1110,they want to have too many programs; they have a tendency to not know when to stop spending;
1112,"the increase of government programs doesn't necessarily solve our problems; criticism of the president; even though I don't agree with the president, the partisan divide is so great that the democrats won't try to compromise in a lot cases;"

1195,idea about taxes goes off the deep end/ going too far into people's pockets/more wishy-washy on issues--sounds good but issues aren't clarified
1205,"One thing, primarily the party forgot the religious factor in politics. For instance one of the issues Bush used against Kerry was his stance on religious issues and the party shies away from addressing this issue. Religion in America is a strong factor. You make a big mistake not addressing this. Barack Obama was strong in addressing his faith."
1206,"the Democrats are soft overall, wishy washy and their support for abortion"
1207,"the one thing I dislike it's like any other political party, they don't vote the people way, I think they go with whoever corece them enough. Once they get into office it's whoever they can get the most from."

1107,"it's all theatre; their platform is basically -- I don't think it's real; the parties are distracting the American public from what's really going on, to give people the idea that they have some power in the system; I really hated that they had their convention here in St. Paul so close to where I live; I think Sarah Palin is a joke, but I think the whole thing is meaningless"
1109,"sometimes they seem to be a little high and lofty; so many of them are wealthy, it's hard for them to identify with the average Joe; the average Joe's pain has to get really bad before they start to realize it; I have the same issue with the Democrats who are equally bad in this area; I'm also opposed to the recent bailout of Wall Street which is only a bail out of the wealthy and one of the stupidest wastes of money ever; it will not result in jobs, raises or increase anybody's credit rating; it will not inspire any bank to take any greater measure of risk for any U.S. citizen; banks and credit institutions brought this damage upon themselves with bad lending practices such as loans to illegal aliens who walk out of their properties in difficult situations; loans with little to no portion down on the properties; when it gets difficult they also walk out of the property, etc.; I'm also unhappy about immigration issues; every day US citizens are losing their jobs to illegal immigrants; it is also driving wages down which is only appealing to big business and at the same time our government is getting less tax dollars and has to make the difference with higher taxes on US citizens; it is also a burden on health causing my health care expenses to rise"
1110,their partnership with big business;
1111,they are pro-life; pro- big business; too conservative; too much power by the religious right
1112,"I read something that the platform wants to eliminate or greatly reduce the renewable fuel standard and I think that's a mistake; I'm not so sure that they understand fully the war on terror; it seems very focused on the war in Iraq; I do believe we need to see it through, but there are other parts of the world where people (alQaeda) hate us that we need to address; unwillingness to compromise and work across the aisle; support of the defense of marriage amendment DOMA"

1148,They're selfish//
1150,They surrounds themselves with mostly the higher class people and forget about the lower class people   They really have no concern for the lower class people//
1151,they seem to selfish and all for themselves
1153,They represent a lie to me.  They know healthcare is up and they said they will fix it and dont //  they know that unemployment is up and they are sending the jobs overseas//

1191,"they allow corporations to take over our gov't, constant tax breaks for the richest"
1193,"abortion policy, gay marriage position, want them to stay out of my personal business, judgmental position"
1194,I have a hard tkime with how pro life they are and how strongly they want the gov to be involved with that. I don't really agree alot with the way they feel life should be lived. It's very hard for me to pick out particular things. I don't agree with the way they think life should be lived. I dislike the way they spend money. Especially this stuff going on with the banks right now. They go back on their word. If you have fundamentals that you stick with then sticlk with them. That goes for both parties.
1195,a bit too conservative because she is pro-choice
1196,they are more for the very very rich and the common folk support the country
1197,more self serving; not that interested in the general public

1203,"they're not democrats,"
1204,"the taxation, the mishandling of the war, the economic situation the country is on now"
1205,"I do not like  their lack of interest in minority groups such as African Americans, Hispanics, and so forth. They don't try to reach me as a voter. I also believe that a heavily domintaed Republican area is mainly redneck. I have also heard Republicans say nthat they can't vote for Obama because he's a black man. Some people are not openminded and they use their closed minds to drive politics. America is a country of immigrants and the importance of accepting and embracing this is not recognised by the Republican party."
1207,"they put big business ahead of the people, being a democratic society the people should always be first."
1209,the whole thing
1211,"they cater more to the rich people and the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. I don't know that much about them. I don't hate them but they don;t seem to want to do anything for people like me, older people and lower income folks."
1212,I think that they're money-hungry and money always affects their decisions. I don't feel people like that can be trusted. They put on this Christian clothing but they're really not Christians.
