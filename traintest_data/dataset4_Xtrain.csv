424,Lack of experience/I think we don't know enough about him/
425,"experience, universal health care I hate, wouldn't benefit me/I feel that, being a  journalism major, people vote for someone because they are charismatic--he may be a good leader, there are a lot of checks and balances, but the experience is the big thing--things he could have voted for, but stepped out and didn't vote, he doesn't get straight to the point with a lot of his answers."
427,"He's a democrat/I just don't agree with the democratic platform/he's too slick, I just don't trust him, he's a good talker"
429,"His inexperience--he hasn't got the experience that it would take/no/we I don't like some his ideas, policies--i think he wrong on propsing the tax the way he has it set up and i don't particuarly like his idea on health care/no"

PEOPLE SAY THAT THE SAME THINGS CASTRO SAID HE ALSO REPATS LIKE SOCIALIST COUNTRY.  AND ALSO THAT HE NOT ALWAYS KNOWS WHAT HIS PLAN IS."
520,"My only fear is that the blacks will rise up in a non constructive way.  It is like someone finding a treasure and now they will splurge.  Misuse of power because the younger black values is not as good as the blacks in the 60's (e.g. Martin Luther King) It will change but not in a good way, that is my fear.  Some of the stuff that Wright said... he was correct in some ways, he was just stating facts about some of the things gov. has done, injecting diseases in blacks... I feel some of the stuff he said was not racist, but the whole overtone was that the white person is bad.  I don't think that white are as racist as in the 40's.  Holding on to that stigma is not correct.  When we make a big issue of a little thing it makes me upset.  I think that in the near future it might not be good for the country but in the future (40 years) it might be positive. The fact that he dosen't want to drill for oil.  I think we should drill now and at the same time look for other sources of energy.  I think he is more against it than for it... I don't know if I am correct but then we will keep on biving billions of dollars to the middle east.  I don't like his wife. Some of the things she said seem racist."

255,"his age,"
257,his foreign policy outlook is definitely more hawkish and i think now more than ever we are extremely vulnerable to engaging in war and combat overseas and it is imperative that we pursue more diplomatic staratgies utilizing out allies in partnership. we dont have the resources to take on the worlds problems with our military.

289,personal traits that rub me the wrong way  he has a fairly explosive temper  - he's extremely old which means that sarah palin will likely be taking over if he is elected - he's constantly talking about his POW status and to me that means insincerity - his issue with houses that he didn't know how many he had - that's he's out of touch
290,his life story  i've done a lot of research on him  his experience in the navy he has been untruthful he covered up what really happened  his record in the navy is atrocious i just think he's a spoiled brat  he just pulled way too many strings to get to where he is today

347,"i don't like his war record,i know he was a pow, he ended up third from the bottom in his graduating class,"
349,"under mc cain i feel there is less chance of real structural change in government including environmental issues - land, and community and the laws we live under are completely contradictory to natural law particularly land and each other.  communism and socialism are closer to my politics rather than capitalism"

419,"He doesn't have the ideals we're going to need for the future, we're going to need someone in office who knows exactly what we need for the country/"
423,"the amount of time that he has been around politics, sort of a double edged sword, which is why i'm glad he brought a younger, fresher vice president into it, good to get a fresh personality"
425,"His age, it wouldn't help if he were to pass away, and Palin is inexperienced, I wouldn't agree with her being president, I'm not 100 percent for Palin/some of the republican view points--I consider myself less of a conservative socially, the whole pro choice, gay marriage, I'm more liberal/"

431,"Because he was a prisoner of war, I was involved with someone who was a prisoner or war, makes people run around like cookoo birds, not knowing what to do"
432,"His age, his voting record, his idealogy on foreign policy/as far he seems to be in the main republican change of thought camp so far as dealing with oil policies, intrusive actions, involving other countries, he's really so similar to Bush and look at the mess were'r in now--it hasn't worked and it isn't working/it's like where his priorities are where money should go, like education vs oil interests, stuff like that, priorities are screewed/"
433,"I heard he's still out for the war, wants to keep them out there, they're pretty much fighting for nothing/"
434,he is very old.
435,"I do not like his attitude on abortion, he's anti, personally I think that's up to a woman and her doctor, plus the fact that he also has Palin as VP, she's strongly anti-abortion, I think she was using her daughter as part of that compaige/I keep thinking that if he dies in office and she becomes president, that makes me slightly nervous, I don't think she knows enough/McCain is too old, my fear is that he might die in offce/he's a professional politician, he's telling people what they want to hear, but the fact that he's so old would make me think twice about voting for him"
437,i think--Ijust don't agree with the republicans and the way they've done things/I don't they've done very good with the country
439,"i think he's going to be another george bush--I don't agree that we're going to win the war, I think we're wasting money having our troops over there.   He doesn't agree with making rich people pay higher taxes, and at first he was hardly saying anything at all but when it started getting closer he started to use Obama's words, saying we need change, I just don't like him because I think he's going to turn out to be like Bush.  I don't even pay attention when he's talking"
443,"I don't like his woman's choice views, birth control and abortioin, he's against that/I'm just not big for Republican. period."
445,"bush thought- voted with him 90 % of the times, war"
446,"I'm not sure he would be openminded, and willing to be flexible"
447,"I feel that he is too anzious to continue military actions.  I also feel he will continue tax breaks for the rich and the oil companies, and he will continue to gut programs that people need like Medicare and Medicaid/When they had the Rep Natl convention, his wife wore an outfit that cost $300,000.   I thought that was insulting to people who don't get enough to eat, can't afford to drive/"
448,He's too old/no
449,"I don't agreee with his views, such as the war, gay rights, abortion/"
450,I don't agree with his tax plans and how he is situated on the war/

454,"he is too old, he chose sarah palin, i dont;t think he will change things enough"
455,i don't think his vice president choice was a good choice
460,he is like president bush - this is not good for me
461,he is a republican
464,"the fact that he backs up Bush, and Bush's beliefs and makes me think he will be more of the same."
465,The Iraq war mainly.  The republicans party constant use of negative ads.
467,i don't think he connects with poor or middle class people.
468,"I think he has Bush ideas, he wants to keep the boys over in Iraq.  I have a grandson in Afganistan."
471,"i don't like him for not bringing our troops back home, and i don't like how he makes sure the rich get richer and the poor get poorer."
472,because he's a republican.
473,"he's a pow and vietnam vet and i've seen how those people react, i'm afraid he might go crazy too.  i'm not him responsible for it but his life was there at that time. he's following bush's policy and this country just can't take that anymore."
474,he's a republican.
476,"the same policies that's going on now, will continue, with war and all of this and the economy, bringing the soldiers home and there's nothing i really care about him period."
481,the fact that he's a republican
483,"the war, about higher taxes"
484,too much like bush
486,"he doesn't want to help middle class people, she has concerns with taxes; can't depend on him to help low income people"
487,"he's a republican, he wants to spend more money"
488,just don't like him

492,hes too mjuch reaganized
494,"he's a republican, he's against everything I stand for"
495,"age, looks like he wants to go to war, foreign policy"
497,same establishment as george bush
500,"all are for the rich people - they don't care nothing for us, why are they going to raise our taxes"
501,"does not lilke some of the things he says - such as fighting over the oil, always boasting about himself"
503,he seems to be late coming up with views that were previously talked about by other candidates and his views seem to have changed and that does not weigh well with respondent.  he is changing his views as time goes on - going with the wind
505,"his foreign policy - not pulling out the troops, not sure of his running mate, he's under the Bush administration (doesn't really care for Bush administration), does not feel confident/comfortable with going through another 4 years with a Republican in office"
506,"he is going to tax health benefits, will ship jobs out of the country,"
507,he is a republican
514,constant mudslinging
515,"character, trajectory and ideals"
516,"he is republican, in this term i do not want to have another republican president, his age, the fact that I want to vote for Obama."
517,"I don't like that he attack Obama and when you read about the issues, they are false.  There was an endictment, he was taking money from a banker that I saw in a documentary and I did not like that."
519,I AM NOT VERY EXCITED THAT HE IS FROM THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.  THERE ARE THINGS ABOUT HIS PERSONALITY THAT KIND OF RUB ME THE WRONG WAY.
520,"he picked the wrong running mate.  I don't think she has enough experience in case he died for her to run the country.  I think he's not a good communicator.  He makes too many mistakes in the speach, he forgets too much.  His timing is off when making a point.  I don't think that the statment he will be for 100 yrs... I don't think he meant it.  We still have people in other countries for other reasons after the war, but they are not there because we are fighting.  I think his health could play an issue, I don't like that he will tax medical... right thing or Obama... I don't know. His wife looks phony, she doesn't come across elegant, like a president's wife.  Times have changed, they don't look like a president's wife like Jackeline Kennedy."
521,I am afraid he will be following the footsteps of bush and what is going on right now in the economy.  We need a big change.
522,"he is republican, knowing that a lot of his policies are in line with the rep. party and that has not worked for the country, my thought is to bring another candidate with different values and ideas to bring the country around."
523,he has given us the same rhetoric that bush and his people gave us and now I cannot risk going that route again.
524,"the woman that he has a vice president, the fact that he put a woman who doesnt know anything besides alaska, the age of mccain is against him,"
525,he might keep on the word
526,because of the busch administration dont want anymore the same thing keep going pro choice they are for pro life if politics were good than i could overlook the pro life but not much else has been good people  i dontg want the government to tell a woman what she cando or not do with her body im not for abortion  im not but
528,"economy,all about the rich and all about the military. is a war vet and I honor him but is a remblance of g bush-i'll vote against him. ,"

575,too old;
576,one is wants to stand in Iraq as long as it takes; his economic policy are typical Republicans ; keeping wealthy rich; middle and lower income will not feel any relief from that.  Has not provided a solid solution for health care;
577,staying in the war; anti abortion;

626,i am almost sure that he will continue George W. Bush's polcies.
629,Republican
630,"I think that basically he is not middle class. he will tax us, the wealthy people such as enron and mega corporations will get the bra ke.  he is cut as bush.  I think we should end the war, the money we spend monthly for the war is ludicrous.  he does not a plan.  picking palin killed it.  he had cancer but he might not make it.  he coiuld die.  she is not qualified to be vp.  Palin is not hillary.  his wife not knowing how many houses he has, he should know, if he had nuclear buttons... would he know which one to punch? His first wife injured, became paralized and when he got back he divorced her and whent with cindy, she has money, and this could have been his motivation.  divorcing his wife was not very loyal.  the more i see him, i see him very angry with obama, making faces gestures, mocking obama, rolling eyes... I don't think he is a good person for a republican president... if they had someone desent like... can't remember, she very smart not as attractive as palin... but he did not pick her.  Palin is very extreme in the way she thinks and does things.  Also my father is 82, always republican, will vote for obama now.  the health crysis is like a 5,000 and we will be taxed and it is not going to work.  I read people that are wealthy and they are also voting for obama and that makes you think he's got it together.  It concerns me, I had a friend who had to go to war, she had a life, got married and sent her off even though she was in the reserves.  alexa burgess... she had to go and leave her children and husband behind. People that volunteer it's fine, but why force people to go.  It is amazing, outstanding.  He is too right wing, if he does become president he will pick court justices that are right wing.  Who is him to say what is the right to do for a woman with her own body.  nobody is as privileged as his wife or palin's daughter... govmt should not get involved in that.  that should be their choice, not ruled by govmt.  They should stay out of the abortion issue.  He wants to freeze spending.  Then discusses health issues, autism ticket.  how will he support that ticket if he wants a spending freeze."
631,he is a lot like bush.
633,"FROM WHAT I HEAR HE WILL KEEP GOING THE SAME AS BUSH AND WE CANNOT KEEP ON DOING THIS.  TOO SIMILAR TO BUSH, THAT IS WHAT EVERYBODY SAYS."
638,"HE HAS THE BEST POLITICS FROM THE ACTUAL GOVMT. THEY ARE REPUBLICANS, i THINK THAT THE CONOMIC SITUATION WE LIVE RIGHT NOW ARE THE RESULT OF SOME MEASUREMENTS LIKE GOING TO WAR, THE MANAGMT OF THE FINANCES."

702,"His age, he said he would only run one term, because of his age, that's it!  Done a good job in congress"
704,"I believe he was too entrunched in Washington status quo to make changes, until he picked his running mate"
706,he changes his mind on all issues depending on which way the wind is blowing; he agrees on George Bush with everthing; he does not want to end the war ; he wants it to go on forever; he has not done anything for Arizona

747,sometimes he gets a little flustered
749,John Mcain is a hot head and a war monger. His policy to keep troops in Iraq despite the similarities of vietnam is insane. Someone who was a POW I would think should no better. He complained about the no objective of vietnam but refuses to see the no objective of Iraq.
751,us all over

767,His age
768,he is not talking about education he talks about oil this and oil that.  He keeps talking about his war record.

789,"He does not undersatnd waht , waht the majority of Americans truly need He's still for the war in Iraq & it's time to come home & deal with problems in America, He does not support a universal health care plan fpr the milionss of Americans who do not have a health care plan He does not have a plan for the economy And I do not support vice president & think it's a game to get more women to vote & support her"
790,"hE'S ""REPUBLIC"" THEY'RE FOR THE RICH & democrats are for the poor. The bail out plan is to help the richX That's what I'm getting from it but I haven't been following it I watched the debastes but I tuned & tuned out."
791,"i'M A FIRE FIGHTER lt. oN FIRE DEPT. rESPONDING TPO EMERGENCEY CALLS, FIRES, MEDICAL SERVICES & 1ST AID, DISASTER RESPONSE"
792,"FIRST OF ALL FOR ME YOU LISTEN TO HIM AND HE SAYS HE HAS A PLAN & YOU NEVER HEAR WHAT IT IS, HE ALWAYS HAS A PLAN BUT NEVER TELl  YOU HOW THEY CAN DO IT. x There's a lot of things his age he's out of touch & always voted with Bush. He does not have a plan of his on. If he had a plan he'd share it. That telles me he doesn't have a plan or you'd tell me. X His running mate she is definately not qualified does not know anything and she may know something about Alaska but not about the world X he can't be a leader & know one knows anything about her. She's a heartbeat anyway from the presidency . X There's a lot of things but I don't think he's fit this man has been a POW for 5 years and he doesn't support the troops with healthcare & supporting them with armour. He is not telling the truth & just wants to be president & he's erractic one day he's saying one thing & the next something else. He brings up people like Bill Ayers from when Barack Obama was 8 & noew he's a college Professor. X He's not updated for how people relate now , He's always talking about the staright talk express & he's not straight. He's been imprisioned & tortured for 5 years & he's messed up in the head."

804,<DK>
807,"Doesn't want to get us out of Iraq - we'll keep them there 100 years; we can't afford to stay as long as we have. His wife is a pot head, she's on dope, and it might rub off on him (from the ""smut"" paper). His politics are different than mine. Anyone who doesn't know how many houses they have, doesn't know the cost of groceries for the common person doesn't understand."
809,"I don't agree with his stand on Iraq. In the debates, he showed his temper and was pretty disrespectful, and I don't think that is the type of man we need as president."

1016,the way he handles his campaign.
1017,"he's a millionaire and it's hard for him to understand the lower class people, you can't relate to something you've not been, I think he's stuck too much on having been a pow, he doesn't need to keep dwelling on that fact,"

1022,he said he is too old. he said we will be in the war how ever long it takes

1108,because he's friends of rich people; he doesn't care about the poor people;
1110,"I don't think he has the political strength; he's soft on some issues, like foreign affairs; to be strong enough to say yes or no on important issues; it's in his demeanor to be on the soft side"

1112,"I'm just not so sure about his view about the war in Iraq; I'm in favor of getting the job done there; I'm disturbed by his comment of staying in Iraq for 100 years; I believe we're on the right track with the troop surge in Iraq; I think we need to rebuild the country, but how long that's the question; we were in South Korea and have had troops in South Korea for the past 50 years and the extended stay in Europe after WWII; how long, that's the question"

1115,his age and him being republican
1116,"they're making too big of a deal about him being a POW; that he's supportive of the war in Iraq -- that bothers me; I think 72 is too old to become first time president; I don't think he represents the average American -- high income, 7 homes; his public speaking skills are lacking"
1119,you worry a bit about his age; I worry about his stance on war;
1121,"I think he's a Bush men; he's supported Bush policies 90% of the time; he's just more of the same to me; he same country, the same ideals, the same values and I think we need that changed; he's a maverick -- that's scary when he shoots from the hop; I don't want a president that shoots from the hip when you've got a button you can press that will cause world wars; he chose Sarah Palen out the blue; too conservative; he's for the wealthy;"

1194,"he seems too ...I'm a democrat and I believe we should get out of this war and he keeps saying we should stay in the war, He has Palin with me and she said some things duiring the debate about the vp having more power and that astonished me. There have to be checks and balances. It's going to be bad if he's elected."
1195,immigration/pro-choice/big business needs more control
1196,automatic dislike for him - no reason in particular
1197,his age. never been interested in republican attitudes.
1198,"the way he carries himself about the war, you can't understand him, one time he's says one thing and another time he says something else. He's got all the money he wants, what does he need with politics? He's just a showoff. How old is he 50? 60? And he's got that young woman? That's money. He's just a showoff."
1199,"his age, the fact that he wants to keeps things the way Bush has them, he also has convinced me on the war issues"
1200,I remember when I was listening to Obama's speech and he said they rushed into the war in Iraq and he said McCain should have stopped and thought about it before they sent the troops into Iraq. They don't use good judgement.
1201,don't agree with him
1202,"the lies, don't trust him"
1203,he isn't appealing to me. I don't like his associates.
1204,"the fact that he's a republkican, his stand on abortion, he has no knowledge about economics aqnd the fact that he wants the war to continue."
1205,"his economic policy is not too amazing to me, his stance on the war in Iraq, authoriziung the war and right now changing his position to go against the war makes me suspicious, the other thing that would make me not vote for him is just listening to his messages. I;m not sure he really understands what the middles class is going through. He has now changed from straight toalk to supporting the current admin. on everything. Now that he's a candidate he's has swirched his story."
1206,his age

R knows veterans with conparable or exceeding  experience who did not get as many medals (28 medals for 20 hours  in the war theater).  voted against Martin Luther King holiday, equal pay for equal work for women, voted for allowing confederate flag to fly over state capitol of Georgia, womanizing & leaving his first wife, his current wife's connections to mobsters (Kemper Marley), selection of Sarah Palin - should never have selected ehr.  he could have chosen someone better.

His politics on the war, parece que no lo ha saciado.  i don't think it's time to continue war but to be more diplomatic, and to construct a better future for the whole world.  instead of wasting money to continue killing it could be better be spent to make the world a better place."

It is like what they were supposed to do they did not do, besides we started a war.  We never did that... It is like if we don't do something they will get us... but seriously????  is this real?
