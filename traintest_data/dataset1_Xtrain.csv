223,"maybe he was too busy trying to please everyone, trying to please too many people"

607,person running against had better views//na
633,BUSH//STOP
636,SARAH PALIN
672,I think because the United Staes was ready for a big change Mccain never got it out that he was different from Busch and the youger generation wanted a change and wanted somone with youger ideas not being a72 year old yong fresh he understood the youger group better than Mccain did
674,him not being black he lost because he was white he lost gagainst the first black presidential canditate that was not balck
703,Because Obama had all the celebraties backing him
747,more people turned out to vote for obama
748,I don't think he fought for it like he should have I think he thought he automatically had it//
750,i the other canadate people didn't want 4 more years of bish gov
754,he spead less money on thje campane
762,lak of money
819,minority vote/

862,running mate
865,"THE PEOPLE BOUGHT INTO THE ""CHANGE"" THAT BARAK OBAMA PROMISED THEM."
915,becasue people wanted a change//that is it
991,because he is a republican and I think people are ready for a change
1098,he lost because he was associated with the failure in the economy and also the low approval rating of the current Republican administration
1117,people wanted change; //I think that's the primary reason
1123,i think he ran a poor campaign//the economy and the current administration probably hindered him//no
1127,age and the lack money//no
1149,He was not qualified
1152,he was not the best person for the job
1168,economy
1173,<DK>
1174,campagin not well organized -- too nice to do the things needed
1176,<DK>
1182,ran out of money
1193,the people wanted change and the Republican party had a stigma with which they associated Bush
1223,his republican party
1255,i don't think his vice president was quite so strong ;at first i thought it was a ingenious move but the further we went along the less i thought so
1264,age
1265,//probably his age//no
1267,because of his age
1271,his views for what he aimed for in the nation
1277,cause he was a republican
1281,the republican party did not do a good enough job of convincing the public about what they were doing
1286,because obama got the young voters
1347,"""didn't get enough votes//don't know why//"""
1388,the real reason why he lost is barack obama being black. the african americans all voted for him. He used his race as an advantage and I think that was wrong. John mcccain was a lot smarter than obama. Obama has no experience. He only had 500 days as a senator and that to me is scary. The US might become communist. If that happens I might have to leave the country.//no
1391,because he did not spend enough money//no
1396,he just wasnt good with words. not as good as obama with his speeches and wording// his age//no
1399,no charisma//it was time to change parties in the white house//bushs iraq war policy//the voters blaming the ecomony on republicans//ignorant voters//no
1401,his campaign people//I don't think they did their job
1438,everybody on welfare voted for him// and surposidly people who were registered were unable to vote.no
1472,I think he lost because the media gave him little coverage and when they didit was neg. and they gave obama all the coverage and it was all positive and they gave him a free pass on negative issues such as rev. wright and the bill ayres.ACORN was a factor also & the media never investigated the fact that he wasn't a natural born citizen as they would have anyone else.//no
1474,he had shifty eyes
1475,because of the electoral votes instead of the number of votes//no
1526,Because of Sarah Palin
1540,too many people voted against him//most blacks voted for him//teens in school voted for Obama because Obama promised them free schooling//no
1548,"honestly, I'm not sure//no"
1574,"because he's a Republican, because he's connected with the present administration//Barack had stacked the decks - he got people to vote for him illegally//no"
1584,poor champain stratagy they held him back
1587,he had chosen a woman to run as his vp
1594,PICKED WRONG VP MATE
1600,cause all the foregin people and black people voted obama had people decieved about he is going to do
1601,he's an idiot
1647,he threw the election//for political gain//never attacked his opponent..he threw it for politcal gain//no
1649,i believe the media & the amount of money spent on media influenced the outcome//Obama was more articulate speaker//the economy was the separation point//no
1696,people are looking for change and were afraid to choose another Republican.
1767,"Because he was white,"
1778,they campained and had buses that took them to the polls.
1791,because they didnt like his running mate and they could not take another four years of the republican policy because he was going to go right along with president bushs policies.
1822,not enough votes// no
1837,"because of the current events during the election, j. mccain did not have a chance//karismaticnot ;//age//no"
1838,Obama ran a good campaign and he appealed to those who have not voted in past elections.
1842,"wrong candidate, been in govdernment to long, not a good speaker"
1844,"he did not have strong conservativae convictions//did not have a clear message//state of the enocomnuy during the last of the election//he did not have full support of the conservative base//people wanted something different, not the same//no"
1848,he didnt reach out and contact more lower class people/obama did//no
1861,because of george bush
1867,"he didn't try hard enought, people was tired of the republicans;"
1881,I THINK THERE WERE MANY FACTORS LIKE HIS AGE AND HIS HEALTH AND THAT HE HAD SEVERAL HEALTH PROBLEMS AND COMPARED TO OBAMA WHO IS YOUNGER I THINK THAT HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT
1908,i dont knw
1931,because obama was able to convince more people that he was the best choice
1940,he is not much different from the other party he has never been a republican
1968,dongt know
1977,he wasnt a firm in his speakingt out on what his or his parties beliefrs
1986,Not enough funding for the campaign-he didn't market himself enough
2011,"I think he lost because people didnt really know what Barack Obama stands for.// the fact that he favored abortion, and he is very liberal, I can't specify.//  He was a very good speaker, (Obama) and he had more money for ads and one of the reason he did, he went back on his word about money donations.  There was some agreement, about getting government donations that they could get and then he changed his mind.//no."
2015,"other people that were suppose to vote did not go out to vote.  in some states it was very close, lots of people did not vote.  They wanted a change"
2055,BECAUSE HE RAN A VERY POOR CAMPAIN.  hE DID NOT GO AFTER OBAMA ON THE ISSUES.  OFFICIALLY HE HAD NOT WON THE ELECTION YET.
2059,George Bush//i just think things had gotten much worse//people have goten him confused with George bush//none
2206,poorly run campaing in the last month// he should have fired all his staff//palin- hurt the campaign// the staff tried to mold her into something that she wasn't. the made her out to look like a bad mother based on her teen pregnancy // the made her out to lookstupid//none
2225,"he couldnt get his ideas out, he wasnt as good a speaker, think not matter what, barack be next pres anyway //"
2229,too old // just too old
2232,"she thought he was going to be another bush, member of bush regime is why he lost // no"
2259,"don't know, but said some people said because the ''that woman in there'' (talking about the female vice-president nomination)."
2316,//age//not having the funds that Obama had to market himself//could have picked a stronger running mate//no
